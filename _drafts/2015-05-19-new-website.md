title: New Website!

So I have decided to switch from the custom server I had before which was based of the python framework flask & apache to a much simpler one based off [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) & nginx. Why Jekyll? well it is one of the more popular static site generators & I have already converted my sister's website over to it a few months back ([beckymiller.co.uk](https://beckymiller.co.uk)). Currently I have used the Hyde theme as it caught my eye, but I hope to move to my own design before long.

Given Jekyll is designed for blogs, I hope to start writing more posts also the code is on github and I now have my own continuous deployment pipeline setup.
