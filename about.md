I am freelance web designer and software engineer specialising in full-stack development based in Cambridge, UK. I love building out ideas especially when they empower others to improve their quality of life.

In my spare time I am involved in my local church, I play with my one year old, enjoy good food and drink, I read, I listen to podcasts and enjoy playing games of the board and electronic variety. I also enjoy skiing, climbing and cycling.

### Background

I have a degree in Information Systems Engineering from Imperial College London, this was a mix of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science.

From there, I joined the Infrastructure Department within [Ocado Technology](http://www.ocadotechnology.com), skilled up on Python, Django & Puppet by creating automations and tools for other developers to provision users and applications on the on-premise servers. I then transitioned to the newly created Cloud Services team to achieve similar goals within AWS accounts to help create the Ocado Smart Platform.

The next step in my career was a move to the edtech startup [Founders4Schools](www.founders4schools.org.uk) which aims to improve the employability of young people by connecting them to local business volunteers. During my time at Founders4Schools we started to build the first version of [Workfinder](https://www.workfinder.com). This is a digital first experience for young people to gain work experience at companies near to them. During my time I heavily used Django, Python & Javascript on a daily basis, as well as many cloud tools to test and deploy code to production regularly.

Just before joining Founders4Schools, I rediscovered my faith and through participating in an Alpha course, I started to attend my local church called [C3](https://www.thec3.uk). During 2017/18 I attended the C3 leadership academy which is for anyone who wants to improve their leadership skills from Biblical foundation.  Additionally during this time I was invited to join the Creative Core team at C3. From this, I started to redevelop the website using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and helped improve the internal IT tooling used by the staff.

Recently, I have started my own company to offer my services as a freelancer or on a contract basis. Do [get in touch](/contact "Work with me") if you think I can help you with your digital needs. When I am not doing client work, I am interested in skilling up in UI/UX design, graphic design, photography and the latest open source software, technologies & tools.
