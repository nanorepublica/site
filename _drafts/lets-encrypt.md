title: HTTPS & Let's Encrypt
---

At the tail end of last year (2015), the Linux Foundation -- check -- announced the public beta release of a new Certificate Authority (CA) under the name "Let's Encrypt". The main thing that differentiates this CA from others is that it is free. Therefore with some free time over the holiday season I took it upon myself to setup certicates for each of the websites I manage.
