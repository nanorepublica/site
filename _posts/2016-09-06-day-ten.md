A really short post today as I have a lot todo today! [This amusing medium article](https://medium.com/@hoffa/400-000-github-repositories-1-billion-files-14-terabytes-of-code-spaces-or-tabs-7cfe0b5dd7fd#.e3fbci63v) popped up in a [weekly newsletter](https://changelog.com/weekly/) I subscribe to, and thought it was worth a share here.

Apart from being amusing and settling one of the oldest scores for software engineers, it really shows the power of BigQuery &amp; open data sets to work on. All that was really required of the author was the idea and relatively small amount of free time to create and run the queries. If you haven't played around with BigQuery I would recommend having a go either with some of the example datasets they have or start putting in your own data (eg web logs).
