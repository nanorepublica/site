So I have been hugely enjoying David Kavady's podcast ['Love your work'](http://kadavy.net/blog/posts/love-your-work-my-new-podcast/), it is such an inspiration to listen to on a weekly basis. From this and several other sources ([thefaithgap](http://thec3.uk/Media/Player.aspx?media_id=173287&file_id=185290)) I have decided to write and publish a blog post before 9am every day. These will vary in length but most likely be short & sweet as I am not the best writer and given my current commute (~50 min train journey) there will be mostly my own thoughts from what I can remember when referencing external material or what I can dream up. Luckily I normally get into work well before 9am so I can correct any links and do a quick check against things I reference.

The main point is that I start writing and put my contribution however small out in to the world and have faith that I can do just that.
