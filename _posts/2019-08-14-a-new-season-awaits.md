I am back and the plan is to write at a more sustainable, consistent pace... fingers crossed!

So having quit my job at the end of June, I then took some time to apply to some other jobs, but it seems that the tech industry for all it's perks still requires people to work 5 days a week. If I am looking for a job I would like to be 4 days/week maximum. On Thursdays, I look after my son, which is exhausting but something that is irreplaceable, basically where I spend my time is more valuable than that extra day's worth of salary each week.

Anyway after multiple failures to secure a job, an interesting thing started to happen at the same time. Multiple people started to approach me about developing a website for them and a couple of them have even referred me to others as well.

Therefore at the beginning of August I registered my own company, akmiller technologies limited! I am excited and nervous all at the same time, but I pray and hope that this will grant me the flexibility to have time with family, earn a living and even develop some ideas that I have. I also plan to write here more, particularly about the practical steps to setting up a business, some of the challenges I face and the ideas that I have started to develop.

Speak soon!
