Hi, I'm graduate Software/Systems Engineer currently working for Ocado, the only dedicated online supermarket in the UK.

However, I am always open to new opportunities in small to medium sized companies around the Greater London area, that are not related to the financial industry,
that offer the prospect to tackle a wide range of problems from intelligent web-apps to low-level hardware problems

I also have a keen interest in artificial intelligence/multi-agent systems, computer vision and machine learning as well as robotics and UAV's.



### Qualifications ###

For my A levels I gained 2 A's in Mathematics and Physics and 2 B's in Further Mathematics and Computing

At degree level, I graduated with a 2:1 from Imperial College London reading Information Systems Engineering MEng.

Finally I have just completed a beginners course short evening course in graphic design at Central St. Martins

### Work Experience ###

I currently work at [Ocado Technology](http://www.ocadotechnology.com) which is the IT department of [Ocado](www.ocado.com).
I am currently responsible for developing new infrastructure systems as part of the Netnix team making the IT infrastructure more autonomous and efficient.

Previously I have worked at [Cotswold Outdoor](www.cotswoldoutdoor.com) as a retail sales assistant at the London Covent Garden store,
as well as doing various part time jobs at Imperial College London.

During my time at University, I worked in the Imperial College EEE Robotics lab on an autonomous helicopter project.

### Interests ###

In my spare time I enjoy playing Video games, watching films, and discussing the finer points of life otherwise known as socialising!

I am also interested in photography, graphic design, robotics especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the latest news in technology and computing.

I also enjoy skiing and rock climbing as well as having achieved grade 5 in the clarinet.
