## Slack Guide

So I have been meaning to write this for while now (like months and months) and finally with the craziness of COVID-19 and my clients being forced to work remotely, I have made time to compile this quick guide to Slack based on a few articles I have read and my personal experience over the years.

Get the online version [here](https://www.notion.so/softwarecrafts/Slack-Team-Messaging-Etiquette-Guide-1388f9992a3f43ffb86f9853f498d01b "Slack Guide") or download a [PDF](https://app.forestry.io/sites/d48i-jj1izxjfa/body-media//uploads/2020/03/26/Slack_Guide.pdf "Slack Guide.pdf") if you prefer.
