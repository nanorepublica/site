I am freelance web designer and software engineer specialising in full-stack development based in Cambridge, UK. I love building out ideas especially when they empower others to improve their quality of life. 

In my spare time I am involved in my local church, spending time with my new family, enjoying good food

### Background

I have a degree in Information Systems Engineering from Imperial College London, this was a mix of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. 

From there, I joined the Infrastructure Department within [Ocado Technology](http://www.ocadotechnology.com), skilled up on Python & Django by creating automations and tools for other developers to provision users and applications on the on-premise servers. I then transitioned to the newly created Cloud Services team to achieve similar goals within AWS accounts to help create the Ocado Smart Platform.

The next step in my career was a move to the edtech startup [Founders4Schools](www.founders4schools.org.uk) which aims to improve the employability of young people by connecting them to local business volunteers. During my time at Founders4Schools we started to build the first

I have a keen interest in artificial intelligence/multi-agent systems, computer vision, machine learning, robotics & UI/UX.

Day-to-day I mainly use Python in particular the Django web framework, Bash & Javascript/HTML/CSS but I am always open to trying new languages & tools hence I am currently teaching myself Java/Android. I do have a fairly deep knowledge of Puppet as well as some experience with Ruby and C/C++

I have taken a series of other courses either as part of my work or for my own interest:

* a beginners course short course in graphic design at Central St. Martins
* online course in Functional Programming & Human Computer Interaction
* Google's Cloud Qualified Developer course
* Internal Web Security Course
* The C3 Academy

## Experience

My current role is part of a very small development team at [Founders4Schools](https://founders4schools.org.uk) in which we are continuing to improve the website. The mission of Founders4Schools is to improve the career prospects of todays children by connecting them with local Business Leaders to inspire them about business and the world of work.

Previously I worked at [Ocado Technology](http://www.ocadotechnology.com) which is the technology division of [Ocado](https://www.ocado.com).
I was working as part of team to developing new software platforms in span our local development, internal cloud systems, AWS & Google Cloud. This is based on Mesos & Marathon with a set of micro-services providing additional functionality allowing developers to declare mult-tier systems in a declarative fashion. In the past I have been responsible for automating existing infrastructure systems and developing new ones as part of the Netnix (Network & Unix) team.

For a year during at Imperial I worked at [Cotswold Outdoor](https://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com) as a retail sales assistant in the London Covent Garden store,
as well as doing various part time jobs at Imperial College London.

During my time at University, I worked in the Imperial College EEE Robotics lab on an autonomous helicopter project.

## Interests

In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, board games, watching films, occasionally building bikes, and discussing the finer points of life otherwise known as a pint down the pub!

I am also interested in graphic design, keeping up with the latest technology & open source software, photography, and robotics.

I also enjoy cycling, skiing & rock climbing as well as having achieved grade 5 in the clarinet.
