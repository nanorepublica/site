title: Secret Santa

In migrating to this new website I did completely forget about a small side project that I developed a few years back just before Christmas. This side project was an aid with secret santa. The basic premise of secret santa is that among a group of people (friends/family/collegues) everyone is assigned another person for whom they need buy a present (usually with a monetary limit); this negates the need for buying a present for everyone as it ensures some level of equality. It can then be fun, once the presents have been gifted anonymously, to guess who got your present for you. More details can be found [here](jh).

The most traditional way of sorting this out would be to put all the names in a hat and pick one out at a time. This can be fraught with problems as you may pick yourself, or there maybe lots of small pairs which is not ideal as it would make guessing potentially easier as well. Therefore I developed a small [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) website that simply takes the names & emails of all participants and then sends an email to each participant telling them for whom they need to buy a present. I now have it back up and running here at [santa.akmiller.co.uk](https://santa.akmiller.co.uk)
