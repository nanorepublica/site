I read this about 8 months back and would definitely recommend (even mandate it) as reading for anyone involved in a technology company. Not only is the book an enjoyable read (quite remarkable when it's about your workplace), but it is very instructive on concepts such as work in progress & kanban. What is special is that it takes place in the context of the Operations/Infrastructure department, which in my experience is slower to buy into these ideas.

You can purchase it on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business-ebook/dp/B00AZRBLHO) or it should be in any good bookstore.
