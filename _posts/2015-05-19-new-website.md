So I have decided to switch from the custom setup I had before (based of the python framework [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) & [apache](http://apache.org)) to a much simpler one using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) & [nginx](http://nginx.org). Why Jekyll? Well it is one of the more popular static site generators & I have some experience from converting my sister's website over to it a few months back ([beckymiller.co.uk](http://beckymiller.co.uk)). Currently I have used the Hyde theme as it caught my eye, but I hope to move to my own design before long.

Given Jekyll is designed for blogs, I hope to start writing more posts, especially since I have now setup Travis CI to deploy this site automatically.
