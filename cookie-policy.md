<h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
<p >
  A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your
  device when you visit, typically containing information about the
  website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to
  recognise your web browser when you return, additional data that
  serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie
  itself.
</p>
<p >
  Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to
  track site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user settings (eg.
  timezone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content
  (eg. advertising, language).
</p>
<p >
  Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to
  as "first-party cookies", and typically only track your activity on
  that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie.
  third parties) are called "third-party cookies", and can be used to
  track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.
</p>
<h3>
  How you can control or opt out of cookies
</h3>
<p >
  If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your
  browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most browsers are
  configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these
  settings to either refuse cookies altogether, or to notify you when
  a website is trying to set or update a cookie.
</p>
<p >
  If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update
  your settings on each individual device.
</p>
<p >
  Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your
  experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean you are
  unable to access certain features and content across the sites you
  visit.
