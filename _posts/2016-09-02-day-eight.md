Two smaller topics for today!

Firstly I attended the [London React Native Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/React-Native-London/), it was an excellent event with 2 very interesting talks, good food and location (many thanks to the fine folks at [Theodo](http://www.theodo.co.uk/) &amp; [Masabi](http://www.masabi.com/)). The first talk explored how to plug the gaps in React Native with the Native Modules API and the second explained about a boilerplate project called [Pepperoni](http://getpepperoni.com/) as well as giving a very swift tutorial on React+Redux. Both were very informative and filled some gaps in my knowledge.

The second topic for today is that the website is getting an small upgrade. Tags that have been appearing at the bottom of each post are now links! These links will take you to all posts related to that tag. I am now also posting to Twitter as well as Linkedin when I publish a post.
